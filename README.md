Interactive Database for Clarence Stein Institute for Urban and Landscape Studies, Cornell University
This project was developed as part of my one year stint at the Clarence Stein Institute housed in the Department of City and Regional Planning. 
I use the experimental package Crosstalk for R to develop an interactive database that lets the user look up past grant awardees from the institute and allow them to add filters on the year of the award and the category of research in which the grant was awarded.
PRs are welcome. To know more, reach out to me at ssk274@cornell.edu
